#In this childrenâ€™s game, two players alternate naming animals. The first player starts
#with any animal, such as elephant. The next player must name an animal that begins with the same
#letter as the one with which the previous animal ended. Thus, the second player could say tiger,
#then the first could say raccoon, and so on. When a player cannot name an animal, s/he loses. Write
#a program that lets two players plays the Animal Game. Use a list to store previous guesses, so that
#they cannot be reused. There should be some mechanism by which a player can indicate that s/he
#gives up, thus ending the game.
