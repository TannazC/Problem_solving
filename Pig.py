#Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die
#doesnâ€™t roll a 1.The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.
#If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to next player.
#Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.
