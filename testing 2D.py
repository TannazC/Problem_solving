# Two players determine how to position a fleet of pirate ships on a
# one-dimensional sea (i.e. along a line) subject to some rules. Once
# positioned, the players alternate turns guessing the locations of the
# ships and firing cannons at those locations in an attempt to sink them.
# The game ends when one player has hit all sections of all of their
# opponentâ€™s ships. This player wins.
# There are game mode options to play with the computer acting as
# the second player. Modes vary in difficulty, which is accessed from a menu.
# Created using V model testing
