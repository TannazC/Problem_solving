#Card Selector: Generate a list of five different playing cards (you may choose how to represent
#them). Display the userâ€™s hand in a nicely-formatted manner. Ask them which card (1-5) they
#would like to play, then remove that card from their hand. Display the new hand. Remember that
#lists in Python are zero-indexed!
