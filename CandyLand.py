# In this game for young children, players move along a trail by drawing cards. Each card
#contains either one or two coloured symbols, which indicate how many spaces to move. For
#example, if a player draws a card with a single red symbol on it, s/he moves directly to the next red
#square on the path. In the case of two symbols, the player moves to the first square of that colour,
#then proceeds to the next square of the same colour. The game ends when one player reaches the
#end of the path, which occurs when a player draws a card and there are no more squares of that
#colour to travel. The game requires no strategy, and is predetermined by the order in which the
#cards are drawn.

#Write a program that simulates two players playing CandyLand. Create a list containing 102
#elements. The first element is the starting position, and the last element is the end position. The
#remaining 100 elements should be coloured squares, in the order red, green, blue, yellow. When it is

#a playerâ€™s turn, generate a random colour and move the player to the next square of that colour. In
#some cases, that player may move two spaces instead of one. When one player reached the end of
#the path, announce the winner.
