#Gomoku starter code
#You should complete every incomplete function,
#and add more functions and variables as needed.

#Note that incomplete functions have 'pass' as the first statement:
#pass is a Python keyword; it is a statement that does nothing.
#This is a placeholder that you should remove once you modify the function.
